This aligns with a common pattern among tech vendors in Lagos’s vibrant ICT markets (like Computer Village), where businesses help customers source both new and refurbished computer equipment.

                Beyond sales, the company provides maintenance and support services. These services typically include routine upkeep, hardware troubleshooting, repairs, software installation, and system optimization — crucial offerings for both individual users and small businesses that rely on dependable ICT infrastructure.
            </p>

            </p>
            <h3>Web Development & Digital Solutions:</h3>

                In response to the increasing digitalisation of businesses, FEMI GLOBAL VENTURES also offers web development and online solutions. These services help companies establish or improve their online presence, develop responsive websites, and integrate key digital functionalities — a growing area of demand as more organizations shift operations online.
            </p>

            <h3>Value to Clients:</h3>
            <p>
